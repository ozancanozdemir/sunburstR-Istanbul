# sunburstR-Istanbul

Sunburst Diagram is a very good tool to visualize hierarchial data. In R programming, there are several ways to create this chart such as plotly, ggplot2 etc. In addition to these packages, ```sunburstR``` package is also used to create interactive sunburst diagram in R. 
I tried to show how we can use this package in R in this tutorial. The dataset used is taken Istanbul Municipality Open Data Portal. (data.ibb.gov.tr). The tutorial is in Turkish, but English version will be added soon.
